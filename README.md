In general, the bar coupon acceptance rate is higher among individuals who go to bars more frequently compared to those who go less frequently. Also, of drivers who go to bars more than once a month, factors like age, passengers, occupation, and marital status didn't really affect the likelihood of accepting the bar coupons. Lower income does seem to have a correlation with a lower likelihood of accepting a bar coupon.
